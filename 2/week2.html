	<h1>Week 2 Homework</h1>
		<h2>Park</h2>
			<p>My park site is going to be for <a href="http://www.manchester.ma.us/pages/manchesterma_recreation/singingbeach">Singing Beach</a> in Manchester-by-the-Sea. I chose Singing Beach mainly because I have spent a lot of time there and I'm familiar with it.
			</p>
			
			</br>

		<h2>Local Small Business</h2>
		<p>I have two ideas that I need to choose from!</p>
			<h3>Option 1</h3>
				<p>One idea for my local small business site is for <a href="http://www.orinocokitchen.com">Orinoco</a>, a Venezuelan restaurant. Orinoco has three locations in the Boston area: one in the South End of Boston, another in Brookline Village, and their newest location in Harvard Square, which just opened in December. I chose this business mainly because their current website is flash-based and can't be viewed on mobile devices. They do have a basic mobile site, but the design is very different than the flash version and there is a disconnect in their visual identity. I also chose this site because I felt it could be fun to design with their Venezuelan theme.
				</p>
			<h3>Option 2</h3>
				<p>A group exercise instructor in Cambridge is developing a retro workout brand. She will lead dance/exercise classes that can develop into parties, club nights, promotional events or classes at a gym or community center. I'm not sure if this will work since it's not an established business, but if it will work, it would be my preference of the two options.
				</p>
				</br>

		<h2>Lobbying Site</h2>
			<p>My lobbying site is going to be a redesign of the <a href="http://oasiscoalition.org">OASIS Coalition</a>, a coalition that seeks to support, empower and give voice to the homeless and poor of Boston.</p>
				<p>The organization's current programs include: 	</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Book Club</li>
						<li>Women's Group</li>
						<li>Monday Dinner</li>
						<li>Sock Walk</li>
						<li>Screenwriter Workshop</li>
					</ul>
