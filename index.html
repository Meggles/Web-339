		<h3>Final Project Description</h3>
			<p>Sailing trips for students around the British Virgin Islands. The website would be a place where students can find information about the boat, captain, the upcoming trip schedule, the trip route and safety information. They will be able to sign up for a trip online and post questions for the captain to answer. There will also be a blog-type page where the captain can post updates about the trip.</p>
